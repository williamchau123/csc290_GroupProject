## How to extend MazeMan

You may extend MazeMan by creating and adding new game elements or modifying existing elements. Here are a few simple examples.

  ### 1. Changing the speed of the ghost
  The speed of the ghost is defined in the file ```actor.py```, within the ```Ghost``` class.  To change the speed of the ghost,
  modify the ```self._delay``` attribute to the desired delay in between moves. A higher value indicates that the ghost will wait         longer before moving and will therefore be slower.
  
  ### 2. Changing the number or location of ghosts
  Each ghost actor and their location is represented as the letter 'G' within the file ```Maze-Man gameboard representation.txt```. To     remove a ghost, replace the letter 'G' with the letter 'O' (to insert a pellet) or the letter 'X' (to insert a wall). To move the       ghost, move the 'G' to your desired location while replacing the whitespace left behind with the necessary letters ('O', 'X', 'P').
  
  Note: Replacing a letter with nothing results in that spot being empty on the game stage
  
  ### 3. Changing the color of the title in the title screen
  Access the ```titleScreen.py``` file within the sampleTitleScreen folder. In that file and within the ```title_screen()``` function,     define the new color of the title according to its RGB representation. Look for the if statement that equates ```current_stage```       with "menu". Finally, in that if statement look for a line that calls the ```drawTitle()``` function and change its 3rd argument to     the new color you defined.


## Authors and Contributions

Below are the list of the authors that created this project,

We will each be talking about our contribution toward the project:

Arne Sokolovic-Created the graphical resources and designed the game stage, created a scoreboard object independent of the game's own function so as to decouple from the game engine.

Nirjari Gandhi-

Jayvin Chang- I created the title screen and victory screen for MazeMan. Additionally, I helped integrate the game stage, title screen, and victory screen elements together and ensured that they were working as intended after integration. For the README file, I wrote up the "How to extend MazeMan" section and provided a few examples of how to extend MazeMan along with it.

Jin Yoshizawa-I wrote all the docstrings in the project. To check the functionality of the game, I did multiple test plays to make sure everything is working properly. 

William Chau- I worked on the documentation for this repository such as the README and license. I also created a .gitignore file to help neglect local generated files.
